Course Description

Not only is religion is found in all human cultures from the very beginning of human civilizations; it also has continuing relevance in today’s societies.1 Though an increasing share of Americans now claim no religious affiliation, the majority of Americans are still religious, and religion continues to influence global societies and events. College graduates who enter a diverse and global workforce will be well served to know and understand the world’s diverse religious ideas.

As a course that fulfills the Humanities requirement in the LARC Curriculum, this course will 

introduce the philosophy and the academic study of religion by observing the broad range of ways human beings experience and think about the sacred.  We will examine the historical origins, philosophical traditions, and contemporary trends of the major religious traditions, noting their fundamental doctrines and beliefs as well as their rituals and practices.
